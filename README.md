## Subject

- MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)

WindJammers 3D game with MCTS AI implementation made with Unity.


## Important

We failed to make our MCTS Agent work. When lauching a game against him, it froze so we decided to comment the ComputeMCTS function line in GameManager.
However most of the MCTS code algorithm principle is in the project.

IsTerminated boolean of MCTS algorithm is not implemented even if it should have been.

Have fun (:
